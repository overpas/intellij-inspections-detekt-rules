# Release

The release workflow runs only on `main` and publishes PR titles as the release body. This skill
puts the changelog and all of `develop` on `main` first, then runs the workflow, then replaces the
release body with the changelog section.

## Audience of the changelog

- The reader is the end user of the rules, not the person who prompts the session. Describe what
  changed for that end user.
- Do not repeat or reflect the instructions, wording or goals of the prompter.
- Leave out internal refactors, CI, agent setup and test-only changes.

## Steps

1. Get the bump (`patch`, `minor` or `major`) from the arguments. If there is none, ask the user.
2. Run `git fetch origin --tags` and `git checkout --detach origin/main`. Get the previous tag with
   `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match 'v[0-9]*'` and the new version with
   `.github/scripts/bump-version.sh <bump>`. The workflow computes the version the same way.
3. Write the changelog:
    1. `git checkout -b changelog-<version> origin/develop`.
    2. Collect the facts from `git diff v<previous>..origin/develop`:

       | Source in the diff                                    | Category                     |
       |-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
       | Rule lists of the rule set providers                  | Added rules, Removed rules   |
       | `@Configuration` properties and their `config` values | Changed options and defaults |
       | Visitor logic of a rule                               | Changed detection            |
       | Rule descriptions and finding messages                | Changed messages             |
       | Build, release scripts, README setup sections         | Distribution                 |

    3. Write a `## <version>` section in the changelog file, above the previous version. Use only
       the categories that have entries, in the order of the table, as `###` headings.
    4. Start each entry with `` `<rule-set-id>`: `<Rule>` `` and say what changed. For a removed
       option, a changed default or changed detection, also say how to keep the old behavior.
    5. Commit, `git push -u origin changelog-<version>` and
       `gh pr create --base develop --title "Add the <version> changelog"`.
4. Merge the changelog PR: `gh pr checks <pr> --watch --fail-fast`. When all checks pass, run
   `git checkout --detach` and `gh pr merge <pr> --merge --delete-branch`.
5. Merge `develop` into `main`:
   `gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "Release <version>" --body "Release <version>"`,
   then `gh pr checks <pr> --watch --fail-fast` and `gh pr merge <pr> --merge`. Do not delete
   `develop`.
6. Run the release: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f bump=<bump>`. Get the run ID with
   `gh run list --workflow release.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId,status,createdAt` (the run can
   take a few seconds to appear), then `gh run watch <id> --exit-status`.
7. Write the release body:
    1. Make sure that `gh release view v<version>` shows the release. If the workflow released
       another version, stop.
    2. Write the changelog section and a
       `**Full Changelog**: <repo-url>/compare/v<previous>...v<version>` line to a file in the
       scratchpad, and run `gh release edit v<version> --notes-file <file>`.
8. Report the version, the release URL and the merged PRs.

If a step fails, stop. Start the report with "Skill incomplete: step N" and the error, then
propose the fix.
